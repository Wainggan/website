	<p>welcome to my haphazardly put together little corner of the internet!</p>
	<hr>
	<p>
		i'm a wip programmer, music writer, and game designer. <br>
		not entirely sure what else to put here.
	</p>
	<p>
		i go by quite a few names online, namely Parchment, Parchi, Parchii, and formerly Wainggan. <br>
		i prefer Parchi.
	</p>
	<p>
		this site was put together using whatever html knowledge I happened to know, so i apologise if the 
		layout is a bit odd or broken. <br/>

		i plan to use this site as a personal outlet for whatever my slightly wacky brain comes up with, the site is
		only public to pay my tribute to the entropy of the internet. <br> 
		maybe i'll be tangibly useful by talking educational things about computer science, game design, 
		drawing, music production, as I continually learn more about the stuff. <br>
	</p>
	<p>expect a lot of todo's to be littered around.</p>
