	i love making games
</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/446102464/">Scratch Cat is Stuck in a Wheelchair</a><br />
		a simple game i made on scratch that I think is worth showing off
	</li>
	<li><a>Ejow</a><br />
		my worst nightmare. what was originally a simple platformer accidently became celeste due to poor planning.
		this was my first "full" game, complete with a terrible original sountrack of 4 songs (including 2 unused
		ones lol), bad art, annoying sound effects, and bugs to boot, all done by me. the result is a game that i'm
		lovingly embarrased about. at least the game itself is somewhat fun.
	</li>
	<li><a>Hyperspace Inc</a><br />
		was supposed to be a jam game done with friends. we couldn't finish it in time due to poor communication. i
		worked on it occasionally after, and as of writing this, the game is unfinished but playable.
	</li>
	<li><a href="neotanks/index.html">Neo Tanks</a><br />
		a reimagining of the classic flash game, Tank Trouble. still in development.
		the controls aren't well explained in game yet, so here: <br />
		when you open the game, you get thrown into a "lobby". from here, you can have up to 4 tanks "join" by
		pressing their corresponding shoot button. the red tank has the arrow keys to move, and either control or
		"?" to shoot. the blue tank has "ESDF" to move, and "Q" to shoot. the green tank has "OKL;" to move, and "Y"
		to shoot. finally, the yellow tank has "8456", and "0" to shoot; this control scheme is intended for
		keyboards with numberpads. you can also press either shift or escape to pause the game, and you can navigate
		the menu with the red tank's controls.
	</li>

		less a game and more an edgy experiment.
	</li>
	<li><a>Bullet Hell Game</a><br />
		my current project. it is inspired by the personality of touhou and the straightfowardness of DonDonPachi,
		though the game isn't afraid to to do more complex bullet patterns (as a rule, patterns are locally somewhat
		complex but simple on a macro scale). the main mechanic is your "grappling hook". you can launch yourself
		onto enemies and do a sort of melee attack when your close, dealing large amounts of damage. this fills up a
		guage, and upon reaching its limit, you can activate a timed "hyperfocus" mode, where bullets are smaller
		and grazing is worth 10x as much points. <br />
		the game is slowly nearing completion. the main 4 levels are almost done, though I'm planning to add at most
		3 additional extra stages. all the music has been drafted (with a total of 8 tracks at minimum, with an
		additional 6 tracks if I do the extra stages, 2 more tracks for the title and end screen, and double the
		stage themes if I feel like overdoing things), with some songs having been finished. graphics are still at
		the placeholder stage.
