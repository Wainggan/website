<h1>welcome!</h1>

<p>welcome to my humble abode, my corner if you will. i’m parchi, the person responsible for this mess.</p>

<p>in this blog, i’ll write about whatever I feel like, but it will likely be primarly educational tutorial-ish things about computer science or music production. i’ll also probably talk about what i’m doing with my current projects/games. who knows, maybe i’ll even do rants about how much i like a game or something, i have literally no idea what im going to do with this thing.</p>

<p>now <em>hopefully</em>, I can get myself to continually update this place with whatever. i decided to finally make a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YjrTjcnHM_Ycu58MMa9wh1ZrOORpj4Qi06B-nJU0sp8/edit?usp=sharing">google spreadsheet</a> of all my project ideas and rabbit holes to get into in the future, which i’ll add to whenever I find anything. it should be enough to get me to continue updating it, but I’m not exactly known for being consistent.</p>

<h2 id="how">how</h2>

<p>for anyone interested in the tech,</p>

<p>i <em>hate</em> html. as a temporary fix until i get a static site generator working, i’m writing this in Markdown, which I store in some folder somewhere, along with <a href="https://parchii.neocities.org/blog/data.json">some json file with the meta data</a> for each post. the <a href="https://parchii.neocities.org/blogindex">blog index page</a> fetches that json file, and displays each post. when you click a post, it brings you to the blog page page (what you are looking at right now) along with a url parameter for which file to get. it then just gets that file, simple.</p>

<p>i compile the markdown using the <a href="https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown">Showdown Markdown converter</a>(chosen because it was written in javascript and generated html <em>text</em>, unlike CommonMark which directly rendered html, and I couldn’t be bothered to see if I could fix that). everything else(css, html layout, javascript) was written by me.</p>

<h2 id="what-now">what now</h2>

<p>no idea. have a nice day :3</p>
